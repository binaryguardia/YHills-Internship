# Introduction to Cyber Security

I have learned the basics of Cyber Security, including its goals and importance in protecting information systems from various threats. Our mentor, Mr. Vaishnvu C V, suggested that we learn at least five programming languages to enhance our understanding and skills in this field.

## Cyber Attacks

Understanding different types of cyber attacks is crucial for developing effective defense mechanisms. Some of the common cyber attacks include:

### Phishing Campaign

Phishing involves fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity through emails, messages, or websites.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker for decryption.

### Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, encompasses various harmful programs like viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering exploits human psychology to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

### Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack

A MITM attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

### Zero-Day Attack

A zero-day attack targets software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the vendor. Since there is no available fix, these attacks can be particularly damaging and difficult to defend against.

## Who is an Ethical Hacker

An ethical hacker is a security professional who uses hacking skills to identify and fix vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks, ensuring they are protected against malicious attacks. They operate with proper authorization and adhere to laws and ethical guidelines.

## What is Hacking

Hacking refers to the process of exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to data. While often associated with malicious intent, hacking can also be performed legally and ethically to improve security.

## Types of Hackers

Hackers can be classified into various types based on their intentions, methods, and goals. Below are the key types of hackers:

### Black Hat Hackers

Black hat hackers are individuals who use their technical skills for malicious purposes. They exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems to steal data, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access for personal gain, often violating laws and ethical standards.

### White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)

White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are security professionals who use their hacking skills to help organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities. They operate with permission and follow legal and ethical guidelines to improve security.

### Grey Hat Hackers

Grey hat hackers fall somewhere between black hat and white hat hackers. They may exploit vulnerabilities without permission but do not have malicious intent. Often, they will notify the organization of the vulnerabilities and suggest fixes, sometimes in exchange for a fee.

### Script Kiddies

Script kiddies are inexperienced individuals who use pre-written scripts or tools to launch attacks without fully understanding how they work. They typically lack the skills to develop their own exploits and often seek recognition or cause disruption for fun.

### Red Hat Hackers

Red hat hackers are similar to white hat hackers but with a more aggressive approach. They focus on taking down black hat hackers by any means necessary, often using the same techniques as malicious hackers to combat them.

### Blue Hat Hackers

Blue hat hackers are individuals outside the organization who are invited to test the security of a system before it is launched. They are often used to identify and fix vulnerabilities that internal teams may have overlooked.

### Hacktivists

Hacktivists are hackers who use their skills to promote political, social, or ideological causes. They often target organizations or governments they believe are acting unethically, using hacking to bring attention to their cause or disrupt operations.

### Red Team

A Red Team is a group of security professionals who simulate real-world attacks to test an organization's defenses. Their goal is to identify weaknesses and assess the effectiveness of security measures.

### Purple Team

The Purple Team acts as a bridge between the Red Team and the Blue Team, facilitating collaboration. They ensure that the Red Team's findings are effectively integrated into the Blue Team's defensive strategies, improving overall security.

### Blue Team

The Blue Team is responsible for defending the organization against cyber threats. They monitor systems, detect and respond to attacks, and implement security measures to protect against intrusions.

## Learning Programming Languages

To excel in the field of cyber security, it is recommended to learn various programming languages. Languages like **Python** are particularly useful due to their simplicity and wide range of applications in scripting, automation, and developing security tools.
